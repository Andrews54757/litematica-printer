Litematica Printer
==============
Litematica is a client-side Minecraft mod using LiteLoader.
It is more or less a re-creation of or a substitute for [Schematica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica),
for players who don't want to have Forge installed.
For compiled builds (= downloads), see http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/litematica

## Printer

THe printer feature is like the printer feature from Schematica. In fact, I used their code as reference (credits to them). To use it, just turn on easyPlaceMode and easyPlaceActivationHold and right click on a schematic block.

Compiling
=========
* Clone the repository
* Open a command prompt/terminal to the repository directory
